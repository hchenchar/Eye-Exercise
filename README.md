# Eye-Exercise
Project Description: This project utilizes a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript by displaying a pair of eyes (styled with CSS) on a single webpage (structred with HTML) that are programmed to follow the movement of the mouse on the screen (programmed with JavaScript)
Roadmap of Future Improvements: Looking ahead, I would like to change the color of the eyes to randomly populate a different color every time the page is reloaded, and I would also like to add in additional functionality that allows the eyes to "blink" on every mouse click.
